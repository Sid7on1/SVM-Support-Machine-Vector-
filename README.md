# SVM-Support-Machine-Vector-
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the sklearn digits dataset. By converting image pixel values into numerical features, the model learns to identify digits based on their structure. It demonstrates the power of SVMs in image-based pattern recognition.
